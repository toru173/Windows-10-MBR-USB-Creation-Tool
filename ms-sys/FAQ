Q1: I followed all instructions but my system doesn't boot!?

A1: This is most likely because you are running ms-sys in a Linux environment
    with a 2.6 kernel. The problem is that kernel 2.6 might report a geometry
    incompatible with other operating systems. This makes gnu parted write
    incompatible geometry information when formatting the partition. Ms-sys
    has the switch -p which is supposed to fix the geometry information when
    the formatting program has failed writing this correctly, but also ms-sys
    will write the wrong information for the same reason. This is a known
    problem described in the README which also contains a link to a detailed
    description and a possible workaround for the problem.
